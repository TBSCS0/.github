## About
CS0 is a club at The British School Rio de Janeiro associated with the Computer Science department. The club has three branches with activities related to computer science, programming, engineering and financing.

Advisor: [Oscar Neiva](https://oscarneiva.github.io/)

## [Engineering Branch üöÄ](https://tbscs0.github.io/engineering.html)
The CS0 engineering branch focuses on the production of nanosatellite systems. Among the nanosatellite categories, the CS0 developed a CanSat. Cansats have a small set of subsystems, for instance, the power and energy subsystem, sensors subsystem, and communication subsystem.

## [Programming Branch üíª](https://tbscs0.github.io/programming.html)
The programming branch at CS0 focuses on programming olympiads and competitions. The students participating in this branch have C++ and algorithms tutorial sessions to prepare for the Brazilian Informatics Olympiad (Olip√≠ada Brasileira de Inform√°tica - OBI). OBI is the Brazilian national competition to select the best students in the country for the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI).

Ambassador: Jo√£o Pedro Marujo Costa Pinto
